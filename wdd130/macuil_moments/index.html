        <p> As we learn from Jacob in the Book of Mormon, we are invited to magnify our calling (see Jacob 2:19). Certainly, it becomes harder when we are called to 
            different calling having a busy agenda with family, work, school, and so on. <b>It becomes difficult</b> for many people to know if there are meetings that can help us to know our responsibilities or deliberate about several problems in our organization, also little challenges in knowing when or why we are calling to meet, and who will preside over this meeting or training. Or do I need to participate? Dates, times, and information mentioned above you will discover in this website. As you know if you need <strong> to participate</strong>, the date, the time, and your purpose there, your desire to attend as your ability to share your ideas in these meetings will increase. At the same time, you are increasing in knowledge you are magnifying your calling knowing how you could minister to others more effectively. Just as our Savior has taught. </p>
