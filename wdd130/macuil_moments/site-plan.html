      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p> As we learn from Jacob in the Book of Mormon, we are invited to magnify our calling (see Jacob 2:19). Certainly, it becomes harder when we are called to 
        different calling having a busy agenda with family, work, school, and so on. <b>It becomes difficult</b> for many people to know if there are meetings that can help us to know our responsibilities or deliberate about several problems in our organization, also little challenges in knowing when or why we are calling to meet, and who will preside over this meeting or training. Or do I need to participate? Dates, times, and information mentioned above you will discover in this website. As you know if you need <strong> to participate</strong>, the date, the time, and your purpose there, your desire to attend as your ability to share your ideas in these meetings will increase. At the same time, you are increasing in knowledge you are magnifying your calling knowing how you could minister to others more effectively. Just as our Savior has taught. </p>
      <p>Additionally, <b>this website is designed</b> to be user-friendly and informative, <strong>to help magnify your calling</strong> knowing your calling meetings and other meaningful activities to socialize with others and live the principles of, love, sharing, invite you will strengthen your testimony of your sacred calling in the Church of our Savior Jesus Christ with the messages from inspiration for our stake presidency and other leaders in the stake or ward organization presidencies or callings who are not a part of an organization, that you will have.</p>

      <h3>Stories of conversion to the Lord</h3>
      <p>The stories of conversion to the Lord, are the result of our labor as leaders. For this reason, we invite you to participate in <strong>sharing your own stories</strong> , baptisms, scripture study, family home evening experiences, and more. To help others to participate and strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ. </p>

      <h3>Finding joy in simplicity</h3>
      <p>All the meetings you will be invited to attend will be based on the “General Handbook: serving in the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints” chapter eighteen. You are invited to click on the information link, if you are already related to this chapter, you could skip this part. With this information we strongly recommend you participate, pay attention to participants, and pay attention to the messages of inspiration and support for different members of our wards. 
        Any of the stories, meetings, messages, or recommendations will include any other doctrine that is not the doctrine of Christ.</p>
        
        <p>There is no other website that talks about this topic and is focused on helping you to learn the doctrine of Christ and magnify your calling in this beautiful stake. We will not create content on our own. As an informative website, we are a bridge between you and true resources.</p>

        <p>Finally, if you allow us we would love to invite you to simplify your attendance and ministry. The Presidente Rusell. M. Ballard taught about simplicity in our service, when he talked about the new adjustment that was happening in 2018, saying: “Our ministering efforts will be more successful if we keep our ministering simple. The most joy comes from the simple things of life, so we need to be careful not to think that more needs to be added to any of the adjustments we have received to build faith and strong testimonies in the hearts of God’s children.
          Let’s not complicate things with additional meetings, expectations, or requirements. Keep it simple. It is in that simplicity that you will find the peace, joy, and happiness I have been talking about.” (See Elder Russell M. Ballard, ¨The True, Pure, and Simple Gospel of Jesus Christ¨, General conference April 2019th)
          As you notice above, the purpose of this website is to help you in your efforts to know and accomplish what the Lord has commanded you. (see 1 Nephi 3:7)
